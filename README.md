The first problem was the distance from the WiFi router, and adding to that the house and garage being of wood construction but with foil weather insulation within the walls pretty much blocking all WiFi signals getting out of the house. Fortunately, I found a sweet spot in the garage near the power meter, at a window where the signal is strong enough to keep connected to the router 24/7.

Second problem, power.
